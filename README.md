# Hartree-Fock Energy Calculator for Simple Molecules

## What does this project do?

This project is a computational tool designed to calculate the electronic energy of simple molecules using the Hartree-Fock method. The Hartree-Fock method is a fundamental quantum chemistry algorithm that approximates the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation by considering electron-electron interactions in a mean-field approach.  

The tool will:
- Accept input molecular geometries and basis sets.
- Compute the Hartree-Fock energy using iterative self-consistent field (SCF) optimization.
- Optionally output intermediate results, such as overlap matrices and molecular orbitals.

## What kind of input data does it expect?

- **Molecular structure**: A list of atoms and their 3D Cartesian coordinates (e.g., in XYZ format).  
- **Basis set**: A predefined basis set (e.g., STO-3G or 6-31G) to describe the atomic orbitals.

## What kind of output can the user expect?

- The computed Hartree-Fock energy of the molecule in atomic units (Hartree).  
- Convergence information for the SCF optimization process.  
- Optionally, a visualization of molecular orbitals and electron densities (if visualization tools are integrated).

## Why is this project useful?

This tool can serve as an educational platform for understanding quantum chemistry, particularly the Hartree-Fock method. It can also be extended for more advanced calculations (e.g., post-Hartree-Fock methods like MP2 or DFT) and integrated into larger research pipelines.
